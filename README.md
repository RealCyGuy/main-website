# Cyrus Yip's Personal Website

Version 4 of my website is built with Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS, and Netlify Forms.  
I also used GSAP, Nuxt Content, Spline, Formkit, and Lenis.

You can view the site at [v4--realcyguy.netlify.app](https://v4--realcyguy.netlify.app/).

Past versions: [v1](https://v1--realcyguy.netlify.app/), [v2](https://v2--realcyguy.netlify.app/), [v3](https://v3--realcyguy.netlify.app/). Switch branches to view the source code for each version.
